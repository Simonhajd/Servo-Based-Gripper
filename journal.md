For this project, I wanted to make an underwater-capable robotic gripper with a wrist. so it can grab, and spin. I didnt want to build a full arm since i thought it would be too heavy and power-intense. I looked at the companies I knew alreay made robotic arms for UROV's for reasearch (Bluerobotics and Reach Robotics) and looked at their manuals and given information for inpiration. Reach Robotics uses linear actuators to push a rod in the center of the arm to move the jaws open and closed, and bluerobotics uses a DC motor to essentially do the same thing. However another option I didnt see is servos. So I decided to 3d-model these 3 options to visualize which one would best fit my needs (ease to waterproof, reliability, and torque). I spent a plane ride doing this.

I researched the best waterproof linear actuators in this case, including ones where the rod is sealed off from the body (magnetic) but i landed on a non magnetic 1-inch one since i couldnt find prices for the magnetic ones, and the non-magnetic one seemed more reliable and much cheaper.

I fully cadded each design with joints and constraints to fully visualize how they would work. I downloaded models for the dc motor and the actuator to see the size of each type of the claw. The linear actuator one seemed very weak with its arms but i get i can just use the design from the motor, just wanted to try something different.
